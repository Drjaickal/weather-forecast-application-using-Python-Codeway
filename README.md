* An OpenWeatherMap API key (Free registration available at [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/))

### Instructions

1. **Obtain an API Key:** Sign up for a free OpenWeatherMap account and generate your API key.
2. **Replace Placeholder:** Replace the `api_key` variable in the code with your own API key.
3. **Run the Script:** Save the script as a Python file (e.g., `weather_app.py`) and run it from your terminal using `python weather_app.py`.
4. **Enter City Name:** When prompted, enter the city name for which you want weather information.

### Example Usage
